    !
    ! When undertaking non-adiabatic calculations, modes can be mis-classified or completely missed. 
    ! The former situation arises because the expectation of monotonic-increasing 
    ! formally applies only to adiabatic oscillations; while it can also work reasonably
    ! well for weakly non-adiabatic cases, there are no guarantees. If mis-classification
    ! does occur, then it must be fixed manually by determining which adiabatic mode
    ! the problematic non-adiabatic mode corresponds to.

    ! Missing modes occur for a different reason: 
    ! if a mode has a large growth rate, then the usual adiabatic method for
    ! establishing initial trial roots can fail to find it. In such cases, 
    ! the alternative contour method performs very well.

    !diff_scheme = 'MAGNUS_GL6' ! Sixth-order Gauss-Legendre Magnus; higher order necessary for evolved stars
   
    !! due to convergence difficulties with non-ad mode, change to second order diff scheme
